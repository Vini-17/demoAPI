# demoAPI
An API which can manage Student and Course data offering CRUD operations tracked through RESTful services

In this project:

Students: Students can be added, updated, and removed from the system. Each student has a unique identifier and a name.

Courses: Courses can be created, modified, and deleted. Each course has a unique identifier and a name.

Enrollment: Students can enroll in courses, and the system keeps track of which students are enrolled in which courses. This allows for the management of student-course relationships.

API Endpoints: The project provides RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on students and courses, as well as enrolling students in courses and retrieving enrollment information.

Database: The application uses MySQL database  to store and manage student and course data.

The Spring Boot framework handles database interactions, and provides a robust foundation for building and deploying the project. This Student-Courses project is a common example of how Spring Boot can be used to create a RESTful web service for managing data related to students and courses in an educational context.
